# SimpleChess
A simple representation of playable Chess that can be re-used for evaluation programs, Chess Playing AI and/or embedded into another game. 

# Contrubition Guide
I compile all source files using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [g++](https://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~hutchins/csci241/compiler.htm).

Lately I prefer to use the CLI and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) .

I built the project in Eclipse by choosing the build from Makefile option. I imagine other IDEs support this as well.
