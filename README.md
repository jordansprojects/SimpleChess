Currently I compile all source files using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). 
I had been doing most of my developement through command line using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [g++](https://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~hutchins/csci241/compiler.htm) , but as of late I have been using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). I built the project by choosing the build from Makefile option. I imagine other IDEs support this as well.
